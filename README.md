## Building (Windows Playdate Simulator)
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 (the build.bat later will expect it to be installed in the default location, and have C/C++ compiler features installed)
1. Clone [Pig Engine](https://www.siltutorials.com/pigengine) into a folder called "engine" at the top-level
2. Clone [GyLib](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/gylib) into lib/include/gylib
3. Run build/build.bat
4. There should now be a folder named Playfactory.pdx in the build folder. Open that folder with Playdate Simulator
